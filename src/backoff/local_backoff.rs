/// A thread-local exponential backoff strategy for reducing contention.

/// data structures, where threads compete for the same resource. It exponentially increases
/// the number of CPU spin iterations each time `wait` is called, which helps reduce
/// contention and CPU usage under heavy load.
///
/// # Example
/// ```
/// let backoff = LocalBackoff::new();
/// loop {
///     if try_acquire_lock() {
///         break;
///     }
///     backoff.wait();
/// }
/// ```
